# Invest

Modular framework for front and back end development

## About this repo

This repository contains the project documentation, but it also has some scripts to get up get started:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/commitd/invest.git

# Run this command (it'll clone the other two projects for you)
./setup.sh

# Now go to the project you want:
# cd invest-server
# cd invest-ui
```

## Where's the actual code? 

Quite right!

This is a top level project repository, but the actual code is held under to separate repositories:

* [Invest Java](https://jenkins.committed.software/job/invest-server) for backend server code
* [Invest JS](https://jenkins.committed.software/job/invest-ui) for the frontend web code
